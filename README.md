# Robot_Arm_Project
A robot arm with an ultrasonic sensor extracts the coordinate of the object, 
moving toward the position which the coordinate indicates, and finally lifts up the object.
Inverse kinematics was used to control the angle of the robot arm. 

This project was conducted using Arduino C/C++, and Processing. 
Thanks to many of the previous contributors, we could save our time to get the project be done.

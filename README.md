# Robot_Arm_Project
A robot arm with an ultrasonic sensor extracts the coordinate of the object, 
moves toward the position which the coordinate indicates, and finally lifts up the object.
Inverse kinematics was used to control the angle of the robot arm. 

This project was conducted using Arduino C/C++, and Processing. 
Thanks to many previous contributors, we were able to save our time to get the project done.
